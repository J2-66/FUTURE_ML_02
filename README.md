# FUTURE_ML_02
I develop a Churn Prediction System that identifies which customers are likely to stop using a service. This kind of model is crucial in industries like telecom, SaaS, and banking where retaining customers is more profitable than acquiring new ones.

# 🚀 Project Overview
The Churn Prediction System is a machine learning project designed to analyze customer behavior and predict whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the service).
This helps businesses take preventive actions, improve customer retention, and design personalized interventions.

# ✨ Features 

•	🔍 Data preprocessing and feature engineering

•	🤖 Machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

•	📊 Model evaluation using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC

•	📈 Visualization of customer trends and churn insights

•	📂 Implemented in a Jupyter Notebook for easy step-by-step understanding

# 🛠️ Tech Stack 

•	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)

•	jupyter Notebook

•	Power BI / Matplotlib (for visualization)

# 📊 Sample Output Churn probability predictions for customers
•	Feature importance visualization

•	Confusion matrix and ROC curves

#🔮 Future Scope 
•	Deploy as a Streamlit/Flask web app for interactive predictions

•	Use deep learning models (ANNs, LSTMs) for better accuracy

•	Automate data pipeline for real-time churn detection

•	Integrate with CRM systems to trigger retention campaigns
